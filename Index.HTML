  <h1>Meditation Mentor Questionnaire</h1>
  <p> by Raymond Reed Hardy 
      (c) 1994--2025
  </p>
  <p>
    Meditation Mentor is a diagnostic questionnaire designed to help the readers of my book, Zen Master: Practical Zen by an American for Americans, determine which of several meditation approaches might work best for them. Such questionnaires are imprecise tools. The results may not be accurate. Further reading will be needed unless the person taking the test is already quite familiar with the recommended techniques.
